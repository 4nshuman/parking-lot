Stage 1 - MVP - upload an excel, fill in the metadata -> published to a blob storage, DAG is triggered
    - What is the metadata - form UI
        These are the fields that we want to have on the first version of the Manual Input:

        Field Name	Mandatory	Type	Description
        Asset Name	Y	Short Text	Name of the asset, which will be seted as table name on UC.
        Description	Y	Long Text	Asset description.
        PII Classification	Y	Y/N	Copy from BrewQuest.
        SDI Classification	Y	Y/N	Copy from BrewQuest.
        Product Name	Y	Short Text	Copy from BrewQuest.
        Landing Zone	Y	Selction Box	Copy from BrewQuest.
        Business Domain	Y	Selction Box	Copy from BrewQuest.
        ## Stage - 1 ignore ## Retention Period	Y	Integer	Maximum number of days that this data is going to be retained.(1,3,6,12 months)
        Admins	Y	E-mail(s)	Person that can delete the asset or add new users.(Edit meta, delete file, tag a DAG for stage 2)
        Users	Y	E-mail(s)	Person who can upload a new file version of the asset.(only uploads a new version)
        ## Stage 1 is read only from DAG ##Sync Type	Y	Append / Overwrite	Set if you want the file to be overwritted or appended when a new version comes, only selected once[Defined on DAG created on DAG management tool]
        (Admin can edit the DAG so he should be able to change this as well.)
        File	Y	.csv(is priority)	A file which will be attached.

Qualtiy check on Stage 1 -
    First upload presents a Pop up to list the columns on the excel, user to select the type(Int, Bool) of each column.
    First upload also defines the file extension to use in any subsequent upload
    User saves the selected column types which in turn builds the template for future file uploads
    Second time file upload gets quality checked based on the template built in last step.
        - V1 - 2 basic checks
            - Do we have the correct column(Syntactical and numerical)
            - If Easy - Check if all the rows in the columns have right type based on template defined in first upload
    File should be of the format same as the first upload

Tool for SAZ as well ?
    - Manual input should be enabled for all the zones(SAZ, MAZ, NAZ)
    - Do we allow segregation ? No, its an open for all. No Navigation needed
        - Creator is by default added as an admin, if he wants, he can remove himself manually.
        - all the users and admins added to a new flow should be able to view the flow.

Super User Role - On the BrewDat portal - Would be able to see all. Can be replicated from Brewdat

Metadata - 
    - where does the metadata gets stored ? In the Cosmos-DB, only for the UI to consume.
    - How does it get tagged to the file uploaded to DAG - DAG would not use the metadata in V1, in future once the user updates the yaml while DAG creation and that can be pulled over onto Manual input for re-use since it's the same data.

Error Handling - 
    - Quality check
    - Metadata check ? - Not needed in V1 - in V2 DAG metadata, DAG has a domain, LZ, etc.. so it should match with the user input metadata
    - DAG runs ?? to be decided // V1 - NO

File uploaded - 
    - directly trigger DAG - possible, eliminate Blob storage - Not possible.
    - files need to be stored somewhere since DAGs are cyclic and need the file to be present at the time of run.
    - We can trigger a DAG on demand but the file still needs to be present on the blob for ingestion. 
    - Trigger DAG as soon as file upload to BLOB storage complete.
